			<h1>10 common html mistakes made by beginners </h1>

			</figure>
			<p> As a beginner in web development, it is often very exciting writing html elements that make things happen just as you want it to happen without much stress But there are times it can become very frustrating, when you try out a punch of tags, elements and nothing happens the way you want it to be.<strong>Especially when you know you have done everything right</strong>.<br>

			Now, let's jump into what some of the mistakes, one makes especially as a newbie. 
			</p>

			<h2>1. Forgetting the DOCTYPE</h2>
			<p>
				<figure> <img src="images/doctype-declaration.png" alt="Forgetting the doctype-declaration"></figure>
			DOCTYPE shows browsers the version of HTML you are using. In the absence of DOCTYPE, the browser makes assumptions on the kind of code used. <br>Just imagine a toodler, seeing white paint in a container and thinking it is yogurt &#128556; not good, right??? Unless you label the container as paint, the toodler will make assumptions. 
			<br>That is the same scenario when a browser comes in contact with a document without a DOCTYPE. We all can agree that the results of such a document won't be as good as we expected.<br>
			So, to avoid making such mistakes consider the points below;

			<ul class="tipsandTricks">
				<li>Use DOCTYPE, irrespective of the kind of HTML you use in your code</li>
				<li>Always place DOCTYPE in the first line of your source code</li>
				<li>Take note, DOCTYPE is case-sensitive</li>


			</ul>

			<h2>
					2. Neglecting Character Encoding
			</h2>
			<p>
				Character sets simply tell the web browser the kind of characters used in the page. The character encoding tells the browser what kind of data to read and display. Let's take an example; A page containing the English characters found on our keyboards will have a different character set from the one that displays Japanese or Chinise characters. This is where character encoding comes into play. It’s important to specify a character set of the document as earlier as possible  otherwise the browser will be left to determine the encoding before parsing the document and this may negatively affect the page load time.  For most English Web pages, the character encoding will be entered into the Web page like this: <code>&lt;meta charset="utf-8"&gt;</code>.This meta tag should be within the  <code>&lt;head&gt; and &lt;/head&gt; </code>tags of your Web page and is not case sensitive.

					3. Styling content before choosing default fonts and colors
			</h2>
			<p>
				
			</p>
			<h2>
					4. Wrong placement of Block Elements 
			</h2>
			Before we get into this, it will be of great importance we understand that, <strong>each HTML element is either displayed in Block or Inline</strong>. <br>
			Block elements are <em> elements that always start on a new line and takes up the full width availableon the web page, effectively blocking out any other element from being close to it</em> <br>
			Inline elements are <em> elements that don't start in a new line and only take up width as necessary, thereby allowing other elements to be in line with the inline element. </em> <br>
			With that said, a block element should never &#10060; be placed in an inline element. Let's take an example:
			<blockquote>Give the link of elements in the navigation heading 2</blockquote>
			<span>&#10060;</span> <br>
			<figure> <img src="images/Block-in-INline-elt.png" alt="Block element inside Inline element"> <figcaption> Block element h2 in Inline element a </figcaption></figure>

			<span>&#9989;</span>
			<figure> <img src="images/Block-in-INline-elt.png" alt="Inline element inside Block element"> <figcaption> Inline element a in Block element h2 </figcaption></figure>

			<span>&#128161;</span> If at one point in time you aren't sure if an element is block or inline, tryout this little trick. <br>
			<ul class="tipsandTricks">
				<li> open up your text editor, set it to html and write out the html element, give it a background color and see how it behaves. Check out for these;</li>

				<li>
				Does it start in a new line? <br>
				Does it occupy the whole width or just the necessary??
				</li>

				<li>if it occupies the whole width despite the length of it's content, then it is a block element. Otherwise, it is an inline element</li>
			</ul>

			It is worth noting that, block elements e.g paragraph, section, divs, aside etc make up the structure of your web page and inline elements e.g span, anchor(a) etc belong in the block elements <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/htmL/html_blocks.asp"> Click here for more examples on inline and block elements</a>
			
			<h2>
					5. Weak CSS structuring 
			</h2>
			Most at times, many newbie developers  focus on content and website visual elements instead of focusing on organising CSS styles in a logical manner. Beginners usually write CSS in the order they think, as a result a style declaration can't be found when it is time to do changes.<br>
			<span>&#128161;</span> Always organise your CSS code by structuring the CSS according to the organisation of HTML you are working on. For example; <br>
			<blockquote>
				<ul class="tipsandTricks">
					<li>header,</li>
					<li>body,</li>
					<li>article,</li>
					<li>section,</li>
					<li>sidebar,</li>
					<li>and footer</li>
				</ul>
			</blockquote>

			<h2>
					6. Not using 'alt' attribute in the img tag
			</h2>
			<p>
				Including the alt attribute in an image (img) tag is of <mark>vital importance</mark>. You should be wondering why the highlight on it's importance. Okay, let me tell you why. Before we get to that, let's refresh our minds on what the role of 'alt' attribute actually is. The ALT attribute enables you as the developer to provide alternative information for an image in case a user's device can't load the image properly maybe due to poor internet connection or an error in the 'src' attribute or if the user uses a screen reader
				<ul class="tipsandTricks">
					<li>The primary purpose of the ALT text is to describe images to visistors who are unable to see them. These include, screen readers and browsers that block images.</li>
					<li>The content of ALT attribute helps Search engines to understand what an image is all about</li>
				</ul>
			</p>

			<h2>
					7. Confusing use of Classes and IDs
			</h2>
			<p>
				Classes are for items that are used more than once on one page. This can be a link style that you’ll call in multiple times on one page but doesn’t follow the global link styling. 
			</p>
			<p>Ids are items that are called just once, like the header div.<p>
			
			<h2>
					8. Not using unique names for Ids and classes
			</h2>
			<p>
				Choosing names that are unique is of great importance when it comes to Ids and Classes. Using unique names makes it easy to edit later and also easy to identify in the stylesheet. For example, naming a div as <strong>#home-right-column is better than just #right</strong>
			</p>


			<h2>
					9. Incorrect use of positioning
			</h2>
			<p>
				When first starting out with CSS, positioning is tough to understand. There are five types of positioning values:<strong>static,relative,fixed, absolute and sticky </strong>
			</p>

			<h2>
					10. Using Unsupported tags or attributes
			</h2>
